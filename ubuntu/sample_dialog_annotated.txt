hi, this might be offtopic to some extent, but I can surely use good opinions/ideas, HP Pavilion dv6 with colorful vertical lines, from what I've seen it seems to be caused by heat ! did any of you guys experience something similar?

if you know this is caused by heat the only easy solution is to just make sure you keep it as cool as possible

the problem is I can't live with it, simply cause I move alot which means heat for short well, you didn't help her getting it fixed?

the only QUICK solution I can think of is to get one of those cooling pads they make for laptops with the extra fans in them. yes she had to buy a new screen

yeah I thought of that already, the problem is that it's not fixed yet the problem seems to exist in the screen inverter

due to a very stupid heatsink design I think I should get rid of it

yes even if you buy a new screen it will either only be a temporary fix or not stop completely the only other option is to send it into HP unless you know someone with spare parts yes I think so too, you will always have problems with it at least you will know not to make the same mistake haha

even if I sent it to HP care, it's a temporary fix, they'd replace the inverter same problem exists I think yeah no one learns for free

yeah I'm hoping for that, the problem is that the only solution would be in the inverter itself cause they wouldn't be able to modify my frigin notebook's casing design half the heat goes up to the inverter yes I'm hoping

honestly if you send it in and have it fixed then the battle would be keeping it cool so it doesnt happen again. I would just invest in a better laptop

I'm sure you can find out more on Ubuntu Forums, cause I can't recall at the moment I'll try to remember though :-) slowing down, could be caused by a number of reasons, did you try a tool like htop? to monitor CPU/Mem usage

well htop is a CLI utility that would tell you what's the process using your CPU/Mem the most can you get it?

as far as I recall ccleaner was mostly for Windows Registery, you don't have such thing in a Linux environment great :-)
